In the spirit of reproducible research, MATLAB codes are provided here.  The codes are for implementing AbS quantization algorithms as reported in the paper 'Analysis-by-synthesis Quantization  for Compressed Sensing Measurements' by Amirpasha Shirazinia, Saikat Chatterjee and Mikael Skoglund submitted to IEEE Trans. SP, 2013.

The codes are Written by: Amirpasha Shirazinia, Communication Theory Lab, EES, KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Please feel free to contact me at email: amishi@kth.se.

1. Run AbS_main.
2. You may easily change the simulation setup.
3. You may use other codeponits rather than codepoints provided for N(0,1).
4. You may also use other CS reconstruction methods.
5. ...


Good Luck,
Amirpasha
